This is was a group project complete during the Computer Programming course at Alogonquin College Ottawa.

This project does not have much to show without the proper documentation which I am not allowed to upload.
This project was for a Client where we created a web scraper to obtain infromation from all the nearby in person stores.
The goal of the project was to allow the user to find what they need without traveling to a bunch of different websites looking for what they need. ( in person )
Since it was a "large" scale project we were only tasked with creating the backend of the application which means there is no user interface.
To interact with this application you must use it's backend api.
